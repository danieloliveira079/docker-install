# Install Docker

A quick one liner to install the latest version of Docker on CentOS 7 / RHEL 7 server. This will remove the standard repository version of Docker and replace it with the latest version of the RPM from [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/centos/).

```bash
curl -fsS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/russmckendrick/docker-install/master/install-offical | bash
```
